sonnet18 by William Shakespeare

Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
或许我可用夏日把你来比方

Thouart more lovely and more temperate.
但你比夏日更可爱也更温良

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May.
夏风狂作常摧落五月的娇蕊

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
夏季的期限也未免还不太长

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines.
有时天眼如炬人间酷热难当

And often is his gold complexion dimm’d.
但转瞬金面如晦 云遮雾障

And every fair from fair sometime declines.
每一种美都终究会凋残零落

By chance or nature’s changing course untrimmed.
难免见弃于机缘与天道无常

But thy eternal summer shall not fade.
但你永恒的夏季却不会消亡

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st.
你优美的形象也永不会消亡

Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade.
死神难夸口说你深陷其罗网

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st.
只因你借我诗行可长寿无疆

So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see.
只要人眼能看 人口能呼吸

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
我诗必长存 使你万世流芳
