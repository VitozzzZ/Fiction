<< A single man >>



Waking up begins with saying ‘am’ and ‘now’

For the past eight months, waking up has actually hurt

The cold realization that I’m still here slowly sets in

I was never terribly fond of waking up

I was never one to jump out of bed with smile like Jim was 

I used to want to punch him sometimes in the morning he was so happy

I always used to tell him that only fools greet the day with smile

That only fools could possibly escape the simple truth

That now isn’t simply now

It’s a cold reminder

One day later than yesterday

One year last than last year

And that sooner or later, it will come

He used to laugh mr and then give me kiss on the check

It takes time in the morning for me to become George

The time to adjust to what is expected of George and how he is to behave

By the time I have dressed and put the final layer of polish

On the nows lightly stiff but quite perfect George

I know fully what part I suppose to play

Looking in the mirror staring back at me

It isn’t so much as a face, as the expression of a predicament

Just get through the goddamn day

A bit melodramatic, I guess

But then again, my heart has been broken

I feel as if I am sinking, drowning, can’t breathe
